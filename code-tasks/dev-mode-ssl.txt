1. Goal: be able to test and install the PWA client application in mobile devices. Which
        requires the server to start with SSL using the certificate in "./ztest" folder.
2. Aditional info: 
   2.1. The existing certificate is wildcard for the domain "universalbeachhotels.com"
   2.2. The dev machine already uses "dnsmasq" for the following custom domians:
        - "vite.universalbeachhotels.com" -> 192.168.1.160
        - "dev.universalbeachhotels.com" -> 192.168.1.160
