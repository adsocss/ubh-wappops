# SignalR Reconnection Improvements
**Date:** 27 de julio de 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Overview
Enhanced the SignalR notification service to address reconnection issues where only one reconnection attempt was shown after network disconnection, and the service failed to properly reconnect when the network was restored.

## Problem Description
- After network disconnection, SignalR service showed only one reconnection attempt
- When network was restored, there were no signs that the service was truly reconnecting
- Ping timeout was too aggressive (20s), causing premature disconnections
- Lack of persistent reconnection strategy for extended outages

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Reconnection Event Handling
- **Added `reconnectionExhausted` event**: SignalR client now emits this event when built-in reconnection attempts are exhausted
- **Proper event handling**: Notifications service listens for this event and automatically triggers long-term reconnection strategy
- **File modified**: `BunSignalRClient.ts`

### 2. Multi-Layer Reconnection Strategy
- **Built-in reconnection**: Short-term attempts with intervals `[5000, 10000, 15000, 20000, 30000, 45000, 60000]ms` (with randomization)
- **Long-term strategy**: Infinite reconnection attempts with exponential backoff (30s → 5 minutes max)
- **Network monitoring**: Proactive reconnection when API recovers (checks every 30 seconds)
- **Files modified**: `BunGuestAPITasksNotifications.ts`, `BunSignalRClient.ts`

### 3. Robust Network Recovery Detection
- **API health monitoring**: Monitors both API status and token validity
- **Automatic reconnection**: When network recovers and API is available, SignalR automatically reconnects
- **Connection state synchronization**: Ensures SignalR reconnects when API is back but SignalR is disconnected
- **File modified**: `BunGuestAPITasksNotifications.ts`

### 4. Improved Connection Management
- **Reset mechanisms**: `resetReconnectionAttempts()` method to reset counters when manually restarting
- **Proper state tracking**: Distinguishes between manual disconnections and network failures
- **Connection failure patterns**: Tracks failure trends for better diagnostics
- **Files modified**: `BunSignalRClient.ts`, `BunGuestAPITasksNotifications.ts`

### 5. Better Logging and Debugging
- **Structured logging**: Clear, component-tagged log messages for all reconnection events
- **Debug mode control**: Debug logging can be enabled/disabled (currently disabled for production stability)
- **Connection statistics**: Detailed stats about connection state, attempts, and failures
- **Files modified**: `BunGuestAPITasksNotifications.ts`, `logger.ts`

### 6. Ping/Keep-Alive Optimizations
- **Ping interval**: Set to 15 seconds (reasonable frequency)
- **Ping timeout**: Increased to 60 seconds (from aggressive 20s)
- **Timeout detection**: Proper ping/pong handling with connection recovery
- **File modified**: `BunSignalRClient.ts`

## How It Works Now

1. **Initial Connection**: SignalR connects with built-in automatic reconnection
2. **Network Loss**: When network fails, built-in reconnection tries 7 times over ~3-4 minutes
3. **Exhausted Attempts**: When built-in attempts are exhausted, service automatically starts long-term strategy
4. **Long-term Recovery**: Continues trying every 30s-5min with API health checks
5. **Network Recovery**: Network monitoring detects when API is back and triggers immediate reconnection
6. **Success**: When connection is restored, all counters reset and normal operation resumes

## Key Code Changes

### BunSignalRClient.ts
```typescript
// Added reconnectionExhausted event
} else {
    console.log('SignalR max reconnection attempts reached');
    this.emit('reconnectionExhausted');
}

// Added resetReconnectionAttempts method
resetReconnectionAttempts(): void {
    this.reconnectAttempts = 0;
    console.log('SignalR reconnection attempts reset');
}

// Improved ping timeout (60s instead of 20s)
.withPingTimeout(60000)   // Consider connection dead if no pong received in 60 seconds
```

### BunGuestAPITasksNotifications.ts
```typescript
// Added reconnectionExhausted event handler
connection.on('reconnectionExhausted', () => {
    this.logger?.logError('Máximo número de intentos de reconexión automática alcanzado. Iniciando estrategia de reconexión a largo plazo.', 'SIGNALR');
    this.emitter.emit('maxReconnectAttemptsReached');
    this.startLongTermReconnectionStrategy();
});

// Enhanced network monitoring with recovery detection
if (!this.isConnected() && !this.isManuallyDisconnected) {
    this.logger?.logInfo('Network recovered and API is responding - attempting SignalR reconnection', 'SIGNALR');
    await this.restart();
}

// Disabled debug logging for production stability
.withDebug(false)         // Disable debug logging now that reconnection logic is stable
```

## Results
- ✅ **Continuous reconnection attempts**: Service now shows persistent reconnection attempts instead of just one
- ✅ **Network recovery detection**: Properly detects when network is restored and automatically reconnects
- ✅ **Stable ping timeouts**: No more premature disconnections due to aggressive ping timeout
- ✅ **Long-term resilience**: Can survive extended network outages with exponential backoff strategy
- ✅ **Better diagnostics**: Enhanced logging provides clear visibility into reconnection process

## Testing Scenarios Covered
1. **Short network outages** (< 4 minutes): Handled by built-in reconnection
2. **Extended network outages** (> 4 minutes): Handled by long-term strategy
3. **API server restarts**: Detected by health monitoring and automatic reconnection
4. **Gradual network degradation**: Detected by ping timeout and failure pattern analysis
5. **Manual reconnection**: Proper state reset and immediate reconnection

## Configuration
Current reconnection intervals:
- **Built-in**: `[5000, 10000, 15000, 20000, 30000, 45000, 60000]ms` (with randomization)
- **Long-term**: Starting at 30s, exponential backoff up to 5 minutes
- **Network monitoring**: Every 60 seconds
- **Ping interval**: 15 seconds
- **Ping timeout**: 60 seconds

## Notes
- Debug logging is currently disabled for production stability
- All reconnection strategies work together for comprehensive network resilience
- The service maintains backward compatibility with existing notification handling
- Connection statistics are available via `getConnectionStats()` method for monitoring
